October 4th:
	Audio playing system complete:
	Can load and play sound files at a world location using OpenAL.
	Perhaps ability to play simple sound effects without file data.
	Stretch: Sound manipulation (if it isn’t too difficult, which it shouldn’t be in OpenAL).
October 18th:
	Resource manager for audio files, textures, vertex data complete
	Text rendering from .png character atlas
	Objects can be associated with resources at runtime even before they are loaded.
December 21st (not actual date, may be with next checkpoint):
	Networking system complete (server can update client's world, clients can connect and disconnect, both server and client can send data reliably)
	Start reworking user interface system, improving rendering system.
January 4th:
	User interface system complete.
	Rendering system satisfactory (world lighting, i.e. everything not in light is dark). I'll have to continue learning OpenGL which may take lots of time.
	Start menu/gameplay/content creation.
January 18th:
	Startup menu is complete (singleplayer, multiplayer connect, settings menu).
	Basic game assets and objects are implemented (some player/item/weapon/block models complete and functional). I'm not a very good artist, perhaps seek help?
January 25th-30th:
	Basic gameplay is implemented (a match can be started, teams can fight, a team can win by completing "objective"). Will require new gamemode/gameplay systems, may
	be very difficult to implement well.


OLD:
November 1st:
	Optimize physics/begin networking.
November 15th:
	Networking: ability to send and update world data between client and server.
	World saving and loading from file.
November 22nd/24th (Thanksgiving):
	Improve rendering, particle system.
	Stretch: world lighting.
	Game engine complete, content/game creation begins.
Christmas:
	Content/gameplay/interface complete, only bugfixes and minor tweaks remaining.
End of year:
	Game complete with all features from specification, well polished.
