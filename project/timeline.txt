October 4th:
	Audio playing system complete:
	Can load and play sound files at a world location using OpenAL.
	Perhaps ability to play simple sound effects without file data.
	Stretch: Sound manipulation (if it isn’t too difficult, which it shouldn’t be in OpenAL).
October 18th:
	Resource manager for audio files, textures, vertex data complete
	Text rendering from .png character atlas
	Objects can be associated with resources at runtime even before they are loaded.
As of January 11th:
	Still have not completed networking and am making slow progress towards completing it. I have implemented a basic serialization system for saving game data/objects.
	Goal for the end of the semester is to complete the networking system and get a basic multiplayer system running so that two people on seperate computers can play on the same server.
	To complete the networking system, I need to:
		finish pipeline for incoming packet processing.
		finish reliable message processing/response.
S2 Checkpoint 1:
	Implement basic player networking into the client and server. Ability to send entity updates from server to client and player actions from the client to the server.
S2 Checkpoint 2:
	Create game lobby/better client connecting and disconnecting so that players can join and leave games.
S2 Checkpoint 3:
	Begin implementing lighting system, which may require some heavy changes to the way models and scales/rotations are stored. 
S2 Checkpoint 4:
	The lighting system is complete when light entities/blocks can be created and placed in the world, areas obscured from light sources are dark and areas in the light can be seen and have textures.
S2 Checkpoint 5:
	Rewrite user interface system.
S2 Checkpoint 6:
	Improve physics system by implementing mass in a meaningful way.
S2 Checkpoint 7:
	Create world generation system.
